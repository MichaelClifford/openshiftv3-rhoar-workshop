## Install RHOAR Launch Pad on your CDK

In this lab, we will install LaunchPad for RHOAR. We will use Fabric8 Launcher that is described [here](https://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html#introduction-to-the-launcher-application).

We will use a minishift addon to create this launcher.

### Prerequisites
1. CDK is installed on your workstation
2. You need a GitHub Account. If you don't have please create one at


### Start CDK
* Start CDK based on what you learnt in the last lab
* Open a terminal to run commands using CLI.


### Install Fabric8 Launcher Addon

Navigate to the folder where you copied the flash drive contents. Then change into `addons` folder. Run the following command to install Fabric8 Launcher

```
$ minishift addon install ./fabric8-launcher
```

You should get a response

```
Addon 'fabric8-launcher' installed
```

### Generate GitHub Token

* As mentioned in the pre-requisites, you'll need a github account. 
* Navigate to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Select Generate new token
* Add a token description, for example Fabric8 Launcher tool on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster.
* Select the check boxes of the following parent scopes and all their children:
	* public_repo
	* read:org
	* admin:repo_hook
* Click `Generate Token`
* Save the hex code of the personal access token.



### Deploy the Launcher

**Note** When you run the step below, it will deploy launcher. But launcher's deployment configuration tries to download the latest container images from dockerhub based on their default setting i.e, `ImagePullPolicy=Always`. Image pull will take some time on the network here due to low bandwidth. To make it faster and not wait, we will force the deployment configuration to use the available images. So you will immediately cancel the deployment and change the `ImagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent` in the deployment configuration.

To deploy the launcher you need supply your github username and github token you noted in the previous step. Run the following command substituting the values.

```
$ minishift addons apply fabric8-launcher \
   --addon-env GITHUB_USERNAME=<yourgithubusername> \
   --addon-env GITHUB_TOKEN=<yourtoken>
```

You'll see a response like below

```
-- Applying addon 'fabric8-launcher':....
```

This creates a project with name `rhoarpad` and spins up the launcher in that project. 

Immediately run the following commands to cancel the deployments and edit the deployment configurations so that you can use the cached images.

```
$ oc rollout cancel dc/launcher-backend -n rhoarpad
```

You'll get the following output
```
deploymentconfig "launcher-backend" cancelling
```

Next run
```
$ oc rollout cancel dc/launcher-frontend -n rhoarpad
```

You'll get the following output
```
deploymentconfig "launcher-frontend" cancelling
```

Now run the following two patches to update the deployment configurations:

```
oc patch dc launcher-backend -n rhoarpad --patch '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers": [{"name": "launcher-backend", "imagePullPolicy": "IfNotPresent"}]}}}}' -n rhoarpad
```
you should see the following nessage
```
deploymentconfig "launcher-backend" patched
```

Then run, 

```
$ oc patch dc launcher-frontend -n rhoarpad --patch '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers": [{"name": "launcher-frontend", "imagePullPolicy": "IfNotPresent"}]}}}}' -n rhoarpad
```

You should see the following message
```
deploymentconfig "launcher-frontend" patched
```


Navigate to the project in the web console and you'll see the following in a couple of minutes.
